MVP:

• Enemy obstacles will randomly generate from just behind the top of the screen and move down toward the player.
• The player can shoot and destroy the oncoming enemy obstacles. 
• The player will have three lives, indicated in the top right of the screen. The game will end once all lives have been depleted.
• Enemy deaths will contribute to score count in the top left of the screen.
